# hello-world
my first repository

I want to use this repository to record my whole summer vacation.By using it to make myself get used to Github.I will push all of my code written in Luogu to help me get used to the tool called 'git'.Although it is a strange tool,but I have no choice.

Anyway,this repository represents that I have entered the community 'Github'.

Hope for a good beginning.
